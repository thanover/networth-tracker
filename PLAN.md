# Phase 1: Project Scaffolding

## Goal
Scaffold monorepo with client, server, and Docker config so `docker compose up` brings up React + Express + MongoDB.

## Steps
1. [x] Scaffold server (Express + Mongoose)
2. [x] Scaffold client (Vite + React + Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui)
3. [x] Docker Compose + Dockerfiles + nginx.conf
4. [x] Verify — client builds, server loads, Docker config ready (needs Docker Desktop to run `docker compose up`)
